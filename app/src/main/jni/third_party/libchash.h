 *  This library is intended to be used for in-memory hash tables,
 *  though it provides rudimentary permanent-storage capabilities.
 *  It attempts to be fast, portable, and small.  The best algorithm
 *  to fulfill these goals is an internal probing hashing algorithm,
 *  as in Knuth, _Art of Computer Programming_, vol III.  Unlike
 *  chained (open) hashing, it doesn't require a pointer for every
 *  item, yet it is still constant time lookup in practice.
 *
 *  Also to save space, we let the contents (both data and key) that
 *  you insert be a union: if the key/data is small, we store it
 *  directly in the hashtable, otherwise we store a pointer to it.
 *  To keep you from having to figure out which, use KEY_PTR and
 *  PTR_KEY to convert between the arguments to these functions and
 *  a pointer to the real data.  For instance:
 *     char key[] = "ab", *key2;
 *     HTItem *bck; HashTable *ht;
 *     HashInsert(ht, PTR_KEY(ht, key), 0);
 *     bck = HashFind(ht, PTR_KEY(ht, "ab"));
 *     key2 = KEY_PTR(ht, bck->key);
 *
 *  There are a rich set of operations supported:
 *     AllocateHashTable() -- Allocates a hashtable structure and
 *                            returns it.
 *        cchKey: if it's a positive number, then each key is a
 *                fixed-length record of that length.  If it's 0,
 *                the key is assumed to be a \0-terminated string.
 *        fSaveKey: normally, you are responsible for allocating
 *                  space for the key.  If this is 1, we make a
 *                  copy of the key for you.
 *     ClearHashTable() -- Removes everything from a hashtable
 *     FreeHashTable() -- Frees memory used by a hashtable
 *
 *     HashFind() -- takes a key (use PTR_KEY) and returns the
 *                   HTItem containing that key, or NULL if the
 *                   key is not in the hashtable.
 *     HashFindLast() -- returns the item found by last HashFind()
 *     HashFindOrInsert() -- inserts the key/data pair if the key
 *                           is not already in the hashtable, or
 *                           returns the appropraite HTItem if it is.
 *     HashFindOrInsertItem() -- takes key/data as an HTItem.
 *     HashInsert() -- adds a key/data pair to the hashtable.  What
 *                     it does if the key is already in the table
 *                     depends on the value of SAMEKEY_OVERWRITE.
 *     HashInsertItem() -- takes key/data as an HTItem.
 *     HashDelete() -- removes a key/data pair from the hashtable,
 *                     if it's there.  RETURNS 1 if it was there,
 *                     0 else.
 *        If you use sparse tables and never delete, the full data
 *        space is available.  Otherwise we steal -2 (maybe -3),
 *        so you can't have data fields with those values.
 *     HashDeleteLast() -- deletes the item returned by the last Find().
 *
 *     HashFirstBucket() -- used to iterate over the buckets in a 
 *                          hashtable.  DON'T INSERT OR DELETE WHILE
 *                          ITERATING!  You can't nest iterations.
 *     HashNextBucket() -- RETURNS NULL at the end of iterating.
 *
 *     HashSetDeltaGoalSize() -- if you're going to insert 1000 items
 *                               at once, call this fn with arg 1000.
 *                               It grows the table more intelligently.
 *
 *     HashSave() -- saves the hashtable to a file.  It saves keys ok,
 *                   but it doesn't know how to interpret the data field,
 *                   so if the data field is a pointer to some complex
 *                   structure, you must send a function that takes a
 *                   file pointer and a pointer to the structure, and
 *                   write whatever you want to write.  It should return
 *                   the number of bytes written.  If the file is NULL,
 *                   it should just return the number of bytes it would
 *                   write, without writing anything.
 *                      If your data field is just an integer, not a
 *                   pointer, just send NULL for the function.
 *     HashLoad() -- loads a hashtable.  It needs a function that takes
 *                   a file and the size of the structure, and expects
 *                   you to read in the structure and return a pointer
 *                   to it.  You must do memory allocation, etc.  If
 *                   the data is just a number, send NULL.
 *     HashLoadKeys() -- unlike HashLoad(), doesn't load the data off disk
 *                       until needed.  This saves memory, but if you look
 *                       up the same key a lot, it does a disk access each
 *                       time.
 *        You can't do Insert() or Delete() on hashtables that were loaded
 *        from disk.
