Tests and fuzzers for the native code of PCAPdroid.

The tests are built with the [AddressSanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) to detect memory issues and leaks. They are run as part of the Github workflow.

The fuzzers use [LibFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).

The targets can be run with the provided `Makefile` as follows:

```bash
# Install dependencies
apt install make clang libpcap-dev cmake

# Run the tests
# pcapd log at build/test/test/pcapd.log
make run_tests

# Fuzz the pcapd daemon
make fuzz_pcapd

# Fuzz the pcapdroid capture
make fuzz_capture
```

Cmake `3.18.1` or newer is required. If that's not available for your distribution, you can install it as follows:

```
apt purge cmake

cd /usr
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.23.2/cmake-3.23.2-linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x cmake-3.23.2-linux-x86_64.sh

# answer "n" when prompted to extract in subdir
./cmake-3.23.2-linux-x86_64.sh

# version should now be 3.23.2
cmake --version
```

The following sections describe the PCAP files contained in the `pcap` directory.

## metadata.pcap

Contains HTTP, TLS and DNS connections for both IPv4 and IPv6, suitable to test DPI.

Connections:

## two_flows.pcap

Contains two flows. The first 20 packets of the PCAP are part of the first flow, whereas
the last 29 packets are from the second flow.

```
[TCP4] 192.168.1.10:36922 -> 216.58.208.164:80 [www.google.com]
[TCP4] 192.168.1.10:51588 -> 142.250.180.131:443 [google.it]
```

## invalid_or_unsupported.pcap

Contains packets with invalid or unsupported IP/transport headers.

- Packets with invalid length
- Packet smaller than IP header size
- UDP packet smaller than header size
- Packet with invalid IP version (0)
- Packet with non TCP/UDP/ICMP protocol (CHAOS)
- Packets with IPv6 extensions (OSPF IGP, ESP)
- IP subsequent fragment with first fragment not seen

## crash-*

These files, generated by the fuzzer, caused a crash. They are part of
the seed used by the fuzzer, which ensures no regression occurs.
