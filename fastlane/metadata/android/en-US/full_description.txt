<i>PCAPdroid</i> is an open source app which lets you monitor and export the network traffic of your device. The app simulates a VPN to achieve non-root capture but, contrary to a VPN, the traffic is processed locally into the device.

<b>Features:</b>

* Log and examine the connections made by user and system apps
* Extract the SNI, DNS query, HTTP request, HTTP URL and the remote IP address
* Create rules to filter out the good traffic and easily spot anomalies
* Dump the traffic into a PCAP file, download it from a browser, or stream it to a remote receiver for real time analysis (e.g. wireshark)
* Use the app in combination with mitmproxy to decrypt HTTPS/TLS traffic (technical knowledge required)
* On rooted devices, capture the traffic while other VPN apps are running
