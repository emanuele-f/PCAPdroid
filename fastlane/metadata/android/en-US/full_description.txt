<i>PCAPdroid</i> is an open source network monitoring and capture tool. It can capture an Android device traffic without rooting the device. The traffic can be sent to a remote receiver.

<b>Features:</b>

* Log and examine the connections made by the user and system apps
* Extract SNI, DNS query, URL and remote IP address
* Apply a filter to only capture the traffic of the selected app
* Easily download a PCAP file of the traffic thanks to the integrated HTTP server
* Stream the PCAP to a remote receiver for further analysis (e.g. wireshark)
* Decrypt HTTPS/TLS traffic via a remote mitmproxy

PCAPdroid leverages the Android VpnService to receive all the traffic generated by the Android apps. No external VPN is actually created, the traffic is locally processed by the app.
