# PCAPdroid

PCAPdroid is an open source network monitoring and capture tool. It can capture an Android device traffic without rooting the device. The traffic can be sent to a remote receiver.

Features:

- Log and examine the connections made by the user and system apps
- Extract SNI, DNS query, URL and remote IP address
- Apply a filter to only capture the traffic of the selected app
- Easily download a PCAP file of the traffic thanks to the integrated HTTP server
- Stream the PCAP to a remote receiver for further analysis (e.g. wireshark)
- Decrypt HTTPS/TLS traffic via a remote mitmproxy

**Important**: the PCAP generated by PCAPdroid is not 100% accurate. Check out [PCAP Reliability](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/quick_start#14-pcap-reliability) for more details.

PCAPdroid leverages the Android VpnService to receive all the traffic generated by the Android apps. No external VPN is actually created, the traffic is locally processed by the app.

## What is the netd app

Many applications rely on the Android DNS resolution service `netd` in order to resolve names. In such cases PCAPdroid will be unable to determine the originating app and will instead mark the connection with a question mark. Nevertheless, it will properly capture the selected app DNS traffic when an app filter is set.

## Decrypting HTTPS/TLS Traffic

PCAPdroid supports decrypting TLS traffic by sending it to a customized version of mitmproxy. Check out the [User Guide](https://emanuele-f.github.io/PCAPdroid/tls_decryption) for more details.

## Third Party

PCAPdroid integrates [nDPI](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI) to detect the application protocol of the network connections and extract the SNI from TLS connections.
